        <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
        <p>
          It can be confusing when you start programming, so many things to
          remember! But that is ok - confusion is your brain
          <em>working through</em> something. You will get through it and you
          will be smarter for it!
        </p>

        <p>
          Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right
          direction. Sometimes you want to quit - and you can - but only for a
          little while. Let your mind relax, but never give up. You will come
          back refreshed and progress forward!
        </p>

        <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
        <p>
          Sometimes you won't know why things are happening (especially with
          JavaScript! Oof!) but that's ok. Sometimes you need to just roll with
          it - one day it will make sense.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is normal to not get things - clarity will come - and make you
          better for it!
